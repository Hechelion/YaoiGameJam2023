    Lars, our dragon pilot and main character is riding a dragon ship full of passengers. He’s sitting down on the head of the dragon and peering towards the horizon as the ship nears the destination. He has an uptight posture with a serious expression but his fox tail is swinging side to side from excitement.
Lars (in his head): Discere, cogitare, agere- the triad of wisdom. Learning enriches the mind, and thinking sharpens it, but it is through action that we truly manifest our knowledge and shape our reality.
Lars (in his head): You would think that a merchant guild wouldn’t bother creating such a philosophical motto and instead advertise 1+1 dragon ship seats every holiday season.
Lars (in his head): We could even offer complementary earth meals from the reincarnated human chefs who arrived to the realm of Zephyr.
Lars (in his head):  But then again, we wouldn’t be embarking on artifact hunts and treasure expeditions if our guild’s only purpose was commerce.
    Claude, the rich merchant and our first love interest enters the scene. He is sitting down on the dragons back and leaning on one of her back spikes. He has a relaxed demeanor as if he’s half asleep but still smiling brightly as he calls for the captain’s attention. Though, there isn’t any other passenger to feel bothered by him anyway. Their recent mission was specific to guild embers only.
Claude: Our dearest Captain Lars! are you mumbling to yourself again?
    Lars’s ears are perked up from the loud voice and he tries to maintain a serious posture. However, his tail frails around even more and he’s soon resigned to facing Claude so as to hide his excited tail.
Claude: Or are you whispering trade-secret shortcuts to your, or more so, MY lovely dragon, Spotsy?
Lars: Bad at naming as always, Sir Claude. Especially for this fine species of polka dot ruby fireblazer.
    Cue rambling from Lars as his eyes light up, not for Claude’s teasing but more so because of how he’s going to go on a spree talking about his new ship as a dragon fanatic.
Lars: Look at how these scales are gleaming with a crimson hue! Did you know that as she breathes, the intense heat generated caused by her metabolism can cause the air pockets under her scales to shimmer and expand? These ruby reminiscent distortions aren’t for mere show either, Guild master Sylvian mentioned that certain blacksmiths can use the ensuing heat for their forging practices. I studied a lot about this since Rory mentioned she wanted to help out her family, and you know how she can be as stubborn as a mule. Well, she’s technically a bull descendent so that’s beside the point but-
Claude: Focus on your dragon steering Captain! I wouldn’t want to be that poor passenger who reincarnates early to the Earth realm just because you were adoring our newest ship.
Claude: I did make quite an effort to negotiate for her, after all.
Claude: But this wouldn’t be the first dragon ship I’ve acquired. I need a new challenge after the last one...
Lars: Shhh Sir Claude! You’re going to hurt Spotsy’s feelings. Not to mention, she’ll get confused and make a false move if you don’t stop bothering me.
Lars: The tabloids would have a field day if you were to fall off.
Lars: But more importantly, Guild master Sylvian would be quite upset if our guild got noticed only for your publicity stunt.
Claude: Tsk, tsk, Captain, you should know that a few gossiping papers doesn’t make any difference for me.
Claude: Not because all publicity is good publicity, that’s just a standard industry cliché.
Claude: It’s because I only ever seek to be the greatest merchant there is and I will use every tool at my disposal to achieve it.
Lars: Really? I didn’t know our young master liked being at the center of attention. You always seem to be hiding that you’re the only heir of the infamous Dupont merchant family. At first, I thought it was so there wouldn’t be any rumors of our Guild being associated with your family name, but you’ve always been acting suspiciously about it. You never seem to give out your last name during our expeditions or client meetings and come to think of it your gala partner at the scale ball, did mention that you were using a disguise spell-
Claude: Captain, I didn’t think that you were interested in my personal life all that much.
Claude: I could satisfy your curiosity by merely saying that I enjoy the challenge of making my own name…
Claude: …but then you’ll have to satisfy my curious question as well, which would be the reason behind your wagging tail that you’re so cutely trying to hide-
    Lars instantly starts to feel himself heating up and takes hold of his tail to calm it down, Claude’s teasing did always get the best of him though he tried his best o maintain his composure as the captain. His ears drooped as he tried to look away from embarrassment but he wouldn’t let him have the last word. The least he could do would be to quickly distract him.
Lars: THEN I SUPPOSE you’d have no problem if the headlines were to go like this-
Lars: ‘The rising star, Claude from the infamous Dupont merchant family, tragically plummets to his death as a result of angering the fireblazer dragon ship captain. The tragic mistake of paying 250 thousand gold coins for a chance to reach the skies, only to become a gourmet meal for his ancestors.’
Claude: Haha, my dear captain, are you planning to bankrupt the entire realm with those numbers?
Claude: Or did you hear them from your human passengers again?
Claude: I’ve missed talking with them, but the recent seasonal galas are filling up my timetable.
Claude: Not to mention our recent artifact negotiations. Who knew a single necklace would end up causing me to bicker with the seller so much. 
Claude: You’d think he dug it up from his family grave with the way he clung to it even though it was just a random artifact that appeared out of thin air.
Claude: Besides, captain, you should know better than to recklessly use the Dupont last name.
Claude: I prefer it when you say my name after all. It’s one of the tiny joys of my life.
    The sudden confession surprises Lars and even though it wasn’t the first time that he had heard Claude making such comments, he was nonetheless surprised when they were aimed at him. His fur stands on edge and he finds himself waving his arms around aimlessly as he tries to make sense of his words.
Lars: W-w-what are you saying all of a sudden?! Did you lose your mind?
Lars: If you tease me again, I really won’t be able to guarantee your safety…
Lars: …so, s-stop it.
Claude: Awe, is our captain getting shy all of a sudden? Did you know your ears get red when your embarrassed?
    Lars quickly pulls away his hands from the dragon ships head and puts them on his head. You would think that with his age he wouldn’t be so gullible to fall for someone’s word, but he still had a child-like affliction when it came to Claude and how he tried to compete for his attention.
Lars: Y-y-you just keep spouting lies; I should know better than to trust your lizard tongue.
Claude pays Lars’s embarrassment no mind and continues on unbothered.
Claude: You know, if we ever crash, we could go down the reincarnation route together.
Claude: I wouldn’t mind starting over as long as there’s something new to conquer. We would make quite the adventurous pair as well.
    Claude suddenly takes a more serious expression and though he still has a smile on his face, his eyes venture far away as if he’s too lost in thought to actually weigh the meaning behind his words. But soon enough he returns to his usual carefree self, his charismatic side does tend to turn dark every once in while in the presence of his favored guild members but he never spends too much time delving on it.
Claude: Life gets pretty boring when you have everything you need in the palm of your hand.
Lars: Wait, does that have something to do with your family-
Claude: You know Captain-
Claude: Our mansions scholar, the Archmage of Zephyr, used to tell me that the upper echelon of humans on earth fly in the skies by genetically mutated wings, you could say it’s similar to what Boss Sylvian has. They can even turn their pets to humans while maintaining their innate animal traits such as ears, tails and many more. 
Claude: In fact, you could be similar to one of their domesticated fox breeds and-
    Claude was indeed masterful at steering away the topic of conversation, more so than Lars ever could. That was quite evident since Lars had already forgotten his string of thought and his eyes shined brightly as his ears perked up to hear more of what Claude had to say. Not even wasting a single breath before jumping straight into questioning Claude.
Lars: You’re lying! How on earth did they do that? You’re not teasing me like last time, are you? Like how you mentioned that a couple reincarnated together. Because I did ask Sylvian and he swore that the only mention similar to your story was if two reincarnations happened at the same time and even then, they could end up in a nearby location, but not next to each other. I didn’t hear any of the passengers talk about it either! Come to think of it, Rory did mention some people casting their lover’s dead soul into puppets and releasing them when their partner dies to match the timing, but I thought that was just a children’s tale. Both Sylvian and Rory said-
    Just like that, he had gone on another spree of spouting words without any regard for his conversation partner. Those around him suspected that this trait of his developed due to how much he one-sidedly spoke to the dragons under his care. But no one wanted dampen his excitement and break his trace of sentences. He was indeed cared for in this unique and bizarre way by those around him.
Claude: As much as I hate to cut you off your cute rambling captain, I think we’ll have to save our conversation for later.
Claude: Our dearest guild master’s staff is lighting our landing spot. You’ll be blinded by the number of sunflowers and roses he set up.
Claude: His idea of guiding us with flower colors is as gentle as always.
Oblivious to Lars who is already steering the dragon towards the destination, Claude starts to mumble to himself. His words will be carried by the wind yet they’ll always stay close his heart.
Claude: Yet, it’s frightening when you think of the power he’s hiding in those roots and stalks…
Lars: Ah, it’s a shame. I was hoping to learn something new. We reached home way earlier than I expected as always. I have to reward Spotsy well when we get back.
Claude: I’d be inclined to say that you didn’t manage to tap into our dragon’s full potential captain. Owning up to how I stole your attention for more than half, or better yet, the entire ride.
Lars: Ugh, I should have pushed you off the dragon’s back myself-
Claude: However, since you managed to get us here without any dangerous maneuvers, I’ll allow you to be the first to touch our newest artifact.
Claude: It’s the first time it’s made its way to our side of the realm, making the occasion quite momentous, wouldn’t you say?
    As our two guild members land in the destined area, a tall and thinly magician starts to walk towards them. His name is Sylvian and he is the second male interest of our story. As the guild master, he is the first person to welcome the two back. He nods in the direction of Claude and gives a smile to our main character, Lars. His black wings flutter as he whispers his spell and soon enough sunflowers and roses bloom from his staff. Through another quick motion, he presents them to our companions but more so urging Lars to take it with his strong and kind gaze.
Sylvian: In a sky where dragons soar with grace, a guild of merchants finds its place. With sunflowers and roses in their hands, they guide passengers to enchanted lands. Welcome back, dear members of “Custodes Sylvae”. I’m happy to see that you both landed safely.
Sylvian: Lars, your piloting was truly magnificent as always. It’s a sight that I’m honored to witness every time.
Claude: It wouldn’t be a warm welcome if Master Sylvian weren’t here to recite his poetry. I missed having someone challenging to tease, Captain Lars over here is too gullible and makes it child play for me HAHAHA!
    As Claude boisterously laughed at his own joke, Lars’s ears drooped slightly though he was quick to hide them this time. He didn’t like being resembled to a child especially by someone whose intellect and charisma he admired. He made a point to never show his true feelings for Claude, because if those thoughts were to spill out of his already gateless mouth, it would only serve to make the guild atmosphere awkward especially with their low number.
Lars: Thank you, Master. I wish you could have joined us on the ride too. Sir Claude here almost caused us to plummet to our doom... twice.
Claude: Eh, I did promise to reward you later, didn’t I? drum roll please ~ Behold!-
Claude: Ah, but wait, I seem to have left it on the ship. Captain, could you be so kind as to bring our precious cargo?
    As Lars hurried back to the ship to bring the prized artifact, Claude and Sylvian began to await his return while making a bit of small talk. Soon, another member of the guild would be joining them too.
Sylvian: Claude, remember what I said about teasing him too much? Besides, if Rory catches you giving Lars trouble again...
Rory: Clauuudy~
Rory: I believe I mentioned that if I ever catch you bossing Larsy around, I’d pluck out your lizard eyes to adorn my newest puppet, Agatha.
Rory: You should know that my threats work quite effectively, especially with how Brittney’s puppet dress is shimmering with the scales you’ve kindly donated... in your sleep, of course.
    Our newest character had stepped out from behind Sylvian, true to her nature as a bull descendent, Rory was quick to charge at those who annoyed her. Her relationship with Claude had been rocky with the start but it never did manage to get better owning up to Claude’s flirtatious nature. You could say that they tolerated each other for the sake of the other members.
Claude: If it isn’t our hot-tempered bull, breathing fire as soon as she lays eyes on me. It’s a pleasure to see you again, little Rory. Or should I say, a curse to behold?
Rory: Hoy! I told you never to call me that again! And doesn’t your receding hairline remind you that half your hair now belongs to Puppet Alex because you called me a midget last time?!
Claude: Now, now, I would have to say these finely braided silver strands that I’ve so kindly donated to you are what’s bringing half the revenue for your puppet shows, aren’t they little Rory?
Rory: I warned you not to call me that, you cheap lizard!
Rory: You really have the gall to be talking to me when all your travel funds are conveniently collected from my shows.
Rory: For the sake of compensation, it’s time to say goodbye to Claude Junior with my nifty scissor too-
    Before their conflict of words start colliding in the physical realm as well Lars swiftly returns with a big ornate box in hand.
Lars: I’m back with the cargo!
Rory: Larsy, you’re back! Awe, I missed you so much. One more minute with my arch-nemesis over here and his rag-like face would be honored by my vomit.
Lars: Come on Rory, you don’t really mean that.
Rory: I have never meant anything more in all my bull years.
Claude: That explains why you’re such a bullshitting-
Lars: AHEM! Claude, why don’t you help me out with carrying this box? It’s quite heavy for me to carry.
Sylvian: Are you feeling okay? Do you need me to cast a relief spell for you?
    Instantly, Sylvian uses his staff and mumbles a spell to make the artifact box hover in midair. Lars feels himself sigh from relief, yet a bit embarrassed that his lie to break up the conflict made him look too weak for a single ornate box.
Sylvian: Carrying such heavy things might affect your health after all. That was one of the main things my academic years taught me aside from all the other … unique experiences.
Lars felt obliged to correct the misunderstanding at all costs.
Lars: It’s okay master, I needed to get in my daily dose of exercise too. I don’t want you to think that I’m too weak for one box! I just wanted to make Claude too busy to argue with Rory. You know how I’ve spoilt Rory; I can’t talk back to her in these kinds of situations. More than that, what would our passengers think if their pilot wasn’t able to pick up a heavily gold-adorned box from their dragon’s second cargo-specific stomach and not run around its spiky back, over the landing port, to deliver the artifact? Would they think it’s animal abuse because the dragon isn’t using its second stomach for food? What if they think we’re slaving them away?! My parents wouldn’t let me live this down if they ever heard such rumors. But they don’t use their second stomach for food anyways; it’s mostly for material to build their nests. Ah, but Shabadoo the sheep did say that some species use the second for mined gemstones and Mrs. Parvizi did say that some use it for mating rituals and holding fireflies to light up their ceremonial dance. Maybe I am taking away their chance at doing these things...
Sylvian: Lars, I understand. Now, let’s use that breathing technique that the humans thought us last time. You remember? Breathe for 3 seconds, hold it for 6, and then release it for 9 seconds.
    Lars obediently follows his master’s instructions and sees his breathing slowing down to some extent. Before he could repeat another set of ramblings, Sylvian steps in as the kind mentor he always is.
Sylvian: No one is going to think those things of you, Lars.
Sylvian: In every whispered phrase, a friendship blooms. You who cherish your dragon’s well-being, dispelling any gloom. For their safety, you would give your all. A protector, a guardian, answering their call.
Sylvian: If I were a dragon, I wouldn’t want any other handler than you to take care of me.
Claude: SOOO, what I gather is that Master Sylvian wants to have Lars ride him-
Rory: SHUT UP! You wouldn’t dream of understanding my mentor’s cherished feelings for Larsy.
Rory: Even if he did like Lars that way, it’s not as if he would wait years in an unrequited crush just to waste away his life singing little poetry praises and blooming flowers out of thin air.
    One would think that Sylvian’s secret was out and his love story shared for all to hear. Yet, none could believe that such a gentle guild master would be able to reverently love another for many years, as was the case. No one knew why but they could point to how the guild master’s indiscriminative kindness may have led to the loss of his singular love. In the face of the admiration he received, he could never find the only adoration he craved. The love of one person, who was his junior Lars.
Rory: Honestly, I don’t even know what Lars sees in you that makes him like-
    Seemed like another unrequited love story was in the happenings. Lars had already gotten past his verbal breakdown. His master had a way with words though not quite in the way Claude had. Each had their unique methods of calming Lars down though one was more of a redirection than proper fixation.
Lars: AHHHHHHH- STOP RORY! HOLD ON!
Lars: NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP, NEVER GONNA LET YOU DOWN. NEVER GONNA RUN AROUND AND DESERT YOU.
Claude: As much as I like it when you sing those human songs captain, I think we’re better off witnessing the artifact before the evening sets and little Rory decides to defile my innocent body with her tools.
Claude: I can see fumes exiting her head as we speak. Oh! ************* I think they got even bigger.
Sylvian: Alright everyone, settle down.
Sylvian: Let me cast a safety spell over the box first, you can never be sure if there are any hidden traps inside.
        After a few seconds of sparking light and no noteworthy reactions…
Sylvian: No traps or enchantments detected. It seems we’re in the clear. Let’s unveil the treasure within.
    Sylvian opens the box to reveal a long necklace with a multitude of thick bands and chains resting in a plush cloth. However, the most striking item on the necklace would be the red gem in the middle. The guild members found themselves drawn so much to the ruby hue that they forgot to notice the engravings on the sides of the chains. An ancient language from the time of the original descendants.
Claude: Before anyone starts their inspection, I promised our dear captain he’d be the first person to hold it.
Claude casually pushes the box towards Lars and beckons him to pick up the artifact.
