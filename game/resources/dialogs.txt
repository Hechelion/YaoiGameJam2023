hi!!

Lars, our dragon pilot and main character is riding a dragon ship full of passengers. He’s sitting down on the head of the dragon and peering towards the horizon as the ship nears the destination. He has an uptight posture with a serious expression but his fox tail is swinging side to side from excitement.
*Discere, cogitare, agere*- {sc=5}the triad of wisdom{/sc}. Learning enriches the mind, and thinking sharpens it, but it is through action that we truly manifest our knowledge and shape our reality.
You would think that a merchant guild wouldn’t bother creating such a philosophical motto and instead advertise 1+1 dragon ship seats every holiday season.
We could even offer complementary earth meals from the reincarnated human chefs who arrived to the realm of Zephyr, but I have a feeling that *one particular guild member* of “Custodes Sylvae,” would end up devouring all the dishes before the passengers even get to set their eyes on them.
But then again, we wouldn’t be embarking on artifact hunts and treasure expeditions if our guild’s only purpose was commerce.

Claude, the rich merchant and our first love interest enters the scene. He is sitting down on the dragons back and leaning on one of her back spikes. He has a relaxed demeanor as if he’s half asleep but still smiling brightly as he calls for the captain’s attention. Though, there isn’t any other passenger to feel bothered by him anyway. Their recent mission was specific to guild embers only.
: Our dearest Captain Lars! are you mumbling to yourself again?
