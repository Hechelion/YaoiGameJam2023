    Zephyr "Exactly, what do I get in exchange for all this talking and sharing my top-secret agenda? Huh?"

    Lars narration "From the corner of my eye, I notice Sir Claude preparing himself to jump into our conversation."

    Claude "I’m sure we can reach a compromise if we settle this down like proper negotiators. Threatening someone won’t get you on their side, after all. It will only provoke them to attack."

    Zephyr "Hmph, you’re quite the smooth talker, aren’t you? Lizard-like qualities…"

    Zephyr "I’ll call you Slicky from now on since you think you are so—"

    Claude "Shadowy figure, calls himself weird titles for attention, keeps talking about freezing time and washing other’s minds. I think it’s fairly obvious we have a villain on our hands. Unless you’re not actually the person behind this."

    Zephyr "Of course, I am! I wouldn’t brandish my family name with such buffoonery if I didn’t have a grandiose endgame in mind."

    Claude "Are you sure about that? Maybe you’re just a random kid messing with a weird spell?"

    Zephyr "K-K-Kid?! I’m older than all of you combined! I mean, I’ve been sleeping for a few centuries but ugh that’s not the point! Let me start from the beginning since you’re so quick to make me out to be a villain, Slicky."

    Lars narration "Seems like baiting it was indeed the correct option."

    Zephyr "You see, my family has had this unique time freezing artifact for quite a few generations now. We’d have the responsibility of using it to maintain order and peace in the land as noble dragon descendants of the house of— well, never mind that for now. It’s not necessary for you to know."

    Rory "Seems like we have a delusional con-artist here."

    Zephyr "I’m not lying!"

    Rory "You’re clearly not using it responsibly, now, are you?"

    Zephyr "Hold on there, bull woman, unless you want to be called Speedy or—"

    Claudy "I insist you call her Smally, since she fits the size standard."

    Rory "Ernest Jones called from Earth and said he wants his god complex back."

    Zephyr "Quit trying to shadow my lore explanation, you two."

    Rory "Hehe, shadow…"

    Zephyr "I’ve decided to use the artifact for my personal gain since my present situation calls for it. But it’ll all be worth it when my castle is renovated."

    Sylvian "Were there never any countermeasures set up in the case of someone misusing the artifact?"

    Lars narration "Master’s crucial interjection couldn’t have come at a better moment."

    Rory "Mentor, shouldn’t we use some discretion here? What if it decides to cross us—"

    Zephyr "If we ever strayed from our path and misused it, its couple artifact would counteract the effects of curse. Anyone who touched it, would be immune to the effects of the artifact."

    Zephyr "Basically, the same necklace but with a different colored gemstone and the opposite ability—"

    Sylvian "…Did you say, it was a necklace with a gemstone?"

    Zephyr "Hmm, yeah, what about it?"

    Sylvian "Out of curiosity, where is that artifact now?"

    Zephyr "I’m not an all—knowing encyclopedia now, am I? I don’t have any clue as to where it is now. Someone might have stolen it while I was asleep since it wasn’t there when I woke up."

    Zephyr "Hmph, it’s not like you’ll believe me and the reason why I froze everyone."

    Lars default "Come on, we’re listening to your story right now. Might as well, share the ending with us as well."

    Zephyr "Well, I’ve been sleeping for a few centuries now."

    Zephyr "However, once I woke up, neither of my parents were home and I was still in the body of a young adult."

    Zephyr "You should’ve seen what a wreck my castle had become, and there was no gold either!"

    Zephyr "Many species of descendants have been our faithful servants for the decades that I was awake, however, once I opened my eyes no one was there."

    Claude "Is that why you settled on the title of “Omniscient Lord of Bankruptcy”? Then why would you need two titles like “Malevolent Architect of Debt”?"

    Zephyr "Shh, you can’t cut in while I’m laying down my sob story."

    Zephyr "Like I said, I couldn’t find anyone and the castle was completely empty."

    Zephyr "I searched for so many days but to no avail, I thought that instead of searching, I should start waiting instead. But who could even recognize our family castle with its broken—down state?"

    Zephyr "Eventually I decided to hire some descendants to work for me but they asked for compensation after a few days."

    Claude "But how could you? No money, no family, not even a proper place to sleep in, you’d be knee—deep in debt by this point if you decided to hire people."

    Zephyr "T—That’s ugh…totally—not what h—h—happened. Hahaha…"

    "Everyone" "That’s what happened, didn’t it?"

    Zephyr "They didn’t believe me when I said I was a noble dragon descendent so it was no use appealing to their loyalty."

    Rory "I mean, hardly blame them at this point."

    Claude "Long story short, you just wanted free labor."

    Claude "We’re past the stage of paying others with exposure and influencer points, you know?"

    Claude "Unless it’s me that does it, because they’re getting their gold’s worth and so much more."

    Zephyr "Stop cutting in!"

    Rory "How much longer is this going to take? Can we skip this?"

    Zephyr "DON’T! PLEASE! I’m reaching the good part of the story after all."

    Zephyr "Ahem! So, instead of finding descendants looking for compensation, I decided to hire newly transported humans!"

    Zephyr "Genius idea, I know. They wouldn’t have any qualms for gold either since they don’t understand the mechanics of this realm yet."

    Zephyr "Bonus points, they also accepted the tale of how I am a noble and that I could give them positions in my castle as soon as it was renovated."

    Zephyr "I need a proper place to rest after all and a castle of that size needs regular maintenance."

    Sylvian "You keep mentioning your castle and innocently slaving away unknowing humans. But where is this castle of yours? None of my maps, scrolls, or academic documents have ever pointed to the existence of a secret and perished household like the one you’re describing."

    Sylvian "Not to mention, how does that even result in your usage of an artifact to freeze time?"

    Claude "That’s right! We’ve been walking around this issue for some time now and we haven’t learnt one single coherent thing from you. Just bits and pieces that aren’t helping us get out of this mess. Maybe you’re just a minion for someone else’s plan—"

    Zephyr "I think you’re undermining my generosity here; I gave you so much information for nothing. I could even wipe your brains clean."

    Zephyr "After all, I’m only mentioning these because I haven’t had the chance to properly speak with someone for a long time now so you musn’t think that I enjoy talking to people, okay? OKAY?"

    "Everyone" "He definitely enjoys talking with people."

    Lars default "So, let me summarize, you’re a noble dragon descendent who's been sleeping for centuries and BOOM!"

    Lars default "You woke up, broke and homeless. You decided to use free labor from the descendants to clean up the mess in your castle. However, you couldn’t pay their wages properly. You then decided to slave away unsuspecting humans since they were ignorant about the rules of the realm."

    Lars default "But why did you decide to use the time freeze artifact in the first place?"

    Zephyr "How could I bring them back to my castle without explaining the situation to them? They would get suspicious and run away from now. You know how hard I’ve worked to manually capture the humans and brainwash them to fix up my home?"

    Claude "You’re obviously lacking a certain moral regard to be paying your employees so poorly and even—"

    Zephyr "I didn’t want to, okay? But what other choice did I have?"

    Rory "Literally, anything besides making a house-renovating army of human zombie servants."

    Zephyr "I couldn’t win them over with my title and I couldn’t make them work with the little money either."

    Zephyr "The time freeze did help me in relocating them and making sure I was the first one I spoke to so I could make my situation clear so it was the easier solution for me. I’d pay them back if I got a flow of cash going on."

    Zephyr "I heard that transported humans sell well these days, not to mention celebrities and well—known descendents. If I could get in some scoop, I’d be rich enough to renovate my home without all this extra business."

    Lars default "But you’re still doing the wrong thing. Kidnapping and brainwashing people is only going to work against your gossip column influencer plan here."

    Zephyr "The mind control was always a last measure for me and even now I’m just left with an army of zombies and eternally doomed to be bored out of my mind."

    Claude "Weren’t you the same person who tried to threaten us with brainwashing before you—"

    Zephyr "It wasn’t like I was bluffing to make you spill what info you had. I’m not that forgetful, okay? OKAY?"

    "Everyone" "He’s definitely that forgetful."

label G_1_End:

    Lars default "I don’t need to ask anymore questions for now."

    Claude "You say that, Captain, but I have a question to ask our mystery person."

    Zephyr "Firstly, it’s mystery man and not to mention, I’m getting tired of this interview session ‘Slicky’."

    Claude "Where’s the proof that you haven’t been speaking gibberish so far? Artifact for stopping time? To me, it seems like we have a delusional con-artist here."

    Claude "Merchants always need to showcase their credibility, same goes for someone who’s exchanging our time with childish bluffs."

    Rory "In the first place, why do we have some random kid trying to play mind tricks on us?"

    Zephyr "I'm already centuries older than each one of you, ugh! This group is going to be the death of me."

    Sylvian "This is going to take us even longer if we continue at this pace. Rory, could you come here for a second?"

    Lars narration "Master Sylvian beckons Rory over to his side and starts whispering something in her ear. I can't make out what they're saying, but it seems important enough that he even brings up his wings to cover his mouth."

    Lars narration "However, before I have more time to analyze what was going on, Rory chirps back to our side."

    Rory "You can't die on us yet; I'm planning to give you a timeless puppet show after all!"

    Zephyr "What are you talking about, Speedy?"

    Rory "You mentioned that you wanted to be entertained, right? So why don't I keep you occupied—I mean, uh—keep you \"strung along\" for a private show."

    Rory "I'm sure a person of your caliber is also familiar with these kinds of VIP events, aren't you? Because it would be totally embarrassing if you didn't."

    Zephyr "Wha- of course I have! What kind of noble descendant would I be if I didn't? Come on, then. Entertain me if you can."

    Rory "As expected. It's a good thing I always have my handy puppets for extreme situations like this."

    Rory "Prepare to be amazed by Brittina and Alex, as Agatha still hasn't undergone a complete makeover yet because a certain someone keeps stalling."

    Claude "I wonder who that could be."

    Rory "So, why don't we go around the corner where I have my stall set up?"

    Zephyr "Huh, what about my new army additions here?"

    Lars narration "Good to know that we’re demoted past the nicknames as well."

    Rory "They can't do anything when the time is frozen like this, so why don't we have some fun without any worries?"

    Zephyr "..."

    Lars narration "Is he going to accept?"

    "Everyone" "..."

    Zephyr "Ugh, fine. Might as well enjoy my time with someone who is also interested in puppets."

    Rory "Exactly—"

    Lars narration "However, before Rory has the time to finish her sentence, Zephyr's shadow encloses around Rory and they both disperse without a trace, leaving a momentary respite from his presence."

    Sylvian "It's good to see my junior use her wit to gain us some extra time to discuss certain matters."

    Lars default "That was part of your plan all along?"

    Claude "Obviously, Captain, but we don't have much time to praise our precious boss now."

    Lars default "I'm a bit worried about Rory, though. Maybe I should have convinced Zephyr to let me go with her—"

    Claude "Pfft, she's perfectly fine taking care of her own, and that's coming from me."

    Sylvian "Time is of the essence; let's discuss his claims first—"

    Claude "Let me cut you off right there, boss—"

    Sylvian "As if you haven’t been doing it from the first place."

    Claude "There's only one option here, and that is to accept everything he's saying."

    Lars default "How so, Sir Claude? Isn’t there even a tiny bit of doubt in your mind?"

    Claude "I do believe what he's saying, or more so, I want his story to be true. I've been waiting for a thrilling adventure like this for quite a long time now, and the opportunity is now within my grasp."

    Sylvian "I also think we have to believe what he says. Most notably what he mentioned about the necklace—"

    Claude "But he didn't even know that we have his so-called counter-artifact with us. Especially with how [Lars] has been hiding the necklace under his clothing all this time."

    Sylvian "Interrupting again…"

    Claude "I'd probably miss it too without these handy lizard eyes."

    Claude "But, Captain, you're always stealing the spotlight. If I overlook something crucial, I might have to blame it on being too captivated by your presence. Gotta take responsibility, you know?"

    Lars narration "A low murmur reaches my ears, and I turn my gaze toward Master Sylvian. His expression has shifted into a stern, disapproving look. It's evident that Sir Claude's nonchalant attitude is grating on his nerves."

    Lars narration "But then again, this has been Sir Claude’s personality for a long time; there’s no helping it."

    Lars default "For now, why don’t we hear what Master Sylvian has to say. You’ve been interrupting him for a while now."

    Claude "I’m sure he can speak for himself—"

    Sylvian "Exactly, and I’d like to take a moment to discuss what's really important here if you could set aside your flirtatious act for a second."

    Lars narration "His eyes lock onto mine, and a serene smile graces his lips."

    Sylvian "Thank you for what you just did, [Lars]. I knew you'd stand up for me."

    Lars default "It’s no problem, Master. Now, let’s get back to what you were saying."

    Claude "Tsk tsk."

    Sylvian "From what I understood, that shadowy figure is a noble dragon descendent from the previous dynasty of Divonia."

    Sylvian "Allegedly, he’s been sleeping throughout the centuries by using his family’s time freeze artifact on himself—but we’ll have to save the question about his reason for it for later."

    Sylvian "After all, man is not what he thinks he is, he is what he hides."

    Sylvian "This mysterious person can easily be related to us as well when you consider how the artifact fell into our hands in the first place."

    Claude "I did think it was suspicious how the seller was trying to get rid of the box so quickly. No merchant would try to sell something to the Dupont family at a loss in profits."

    Lars default "I’m sorry too. I messed up big time. I shouldn’t have put any of you in this situation. What kind of dragon pilot am I if I can't ensure the safety of those around me?"

    Sylvian "Don’t be too hard on yourself, [Lars]. We were all caught up in the excitement of a mysterious artifact. It’s easy to overlook the finer details in such situations. But now that we know, we can approach this with caution and ensure we don’t fall for any more tricks."

    Claude "Speaking of tricks, I’ve never heard of a historical event mentioning a missing noble descendant, not even from my tutor, the Archmage of Divonia. What do you make of that, Boss?"

    Sylvian "I’m not all too sure, there are many secrets in the academic realm that are being hidden from the masses from my experience. However, this does not seem to be the case, maybe his brainwashing powers had a role in this story as well…"

    Sylvian "But that’s not what we’re going to discuss right now. Before our young Lord arrives, we need to gather our information."

    Lars narration "That’s right."

    Lars narration "I take a deep breath as if to compensate for all the rambling that I’m about to do"

    Lars default "To summarize, he’s using the legacy necklace to suspend time for everyone, and it’s supposedly structurally identical to the artifact we have albeit with a different gemstone and contrasting ability."

    Lars default "I also believe that the reason we escaped from his spells’ affects was because of this necklace right here."

    Lars narration "I glance down at the accessory that I’ve carefully concealed beneath my dragon pilot equipment, and my heart skips a beat when I see that it’s still shining brightly with a vivid red glow."

    Lars narration "The heat it emitted during our earlier encounter with Zephyr may have subsided, but its enchanting radiance remains."

    Lars default "Now that I think about it, he mentioned that he doesn’t know where this artifact was, even though the two couple necklaces were supposed to be under his care this entire time. But my question is, why did this variable suddenly make us the exception to the time freeze effect?"

    Claude "…"

    Claude "Maybe it’s related to touching the artifact."

    Sylvian "What do you mean?"

    Claude "Think about it."

    Claude "We all experienced this phenomenon after holding the necklace, and we were the only people who touched it after unboxing the entire thing."

    Claude "If it was related to the presence of the artifact in a known area, then why wasn’t anyone else near the seashore also affected by its counteracting abilities? The weird shadow also said something similar."

    Lars default "Quite the detective, aren't you? I didn't realize I had a master of deduction by my side."

    Claude "Oh, Captain, you'll discover even more intriguing talents if you stick around with me."

    Sylvian "Enough flirting, Claude."

    Claude "Yeah yeah, whatever you say, big boss."

    Claude "His plan to renovate his castle seems ludicrous to me though."

    Claude "Hiring descendants only to realize he can’t pay his way through. Going for humans and not even offering to inform them of the rules around here. It’s both malicious and strangely naive at the same time."

    Lars default "What about the people who are currently captured by him? How do we convince him to let them go?"

    Sylvian "“To lose patience is to lose the battle.”"

    Sylvian "Let’s take this one step at a time."

    Sylvian "After our deck is complete, we can use our hidden ace and free the people under his spell. It may be late for those who fell victim to his scheme, but we need to put a stop to this time suspension phenomenon."

    Lars default "But how are we supposed to do that? He already wants to stop us by adding us to his zombie human army since he believes we’ll spoil his plans."

    Lars default "Also, I can’t figure out why he’s giving all this info to us, knowing it’s going to work against him. Does he have another plan in mind?"

    Sylvian "Like I said, he’s probably just a naive kid. But we can use that to our advantage."

    Sylvian "Fortunately for us, a threatening tongue reveals a wayward start."

    Sylvian "For in loose words, a tale unfolds, of inner battles and stories untold."

    Claude "I’d like to think that one of his screws is missing."

    Lars default "But I’m assuming we’re going to keep up with that lie?"

    Sylvian "I think it’s best that we do, otherwise, we’ll be spilling the reason as to why we’re not influenced by his artifact, and how the countermeasure necklace has fallen into the palm of our hands."

    Lars default "We can’t keep up the lie for too long! He’ll eventually notice."

    Lars narration "Speak of the devil, Zephyr’s black particles coalesce once more and he and Rory appear side-by-side. My initial worry dissipates as they emerge with grins plastered across their faces."

    Zephyr "Finished with the banter and jokes? Speedy here kept me quite occupied, I must say."

    Rory "Petition to make this guy our story antagonist, we’ll have a 99.9% chance of success in distracting him and making him spill everything after a little nudge."

    Zephyr "I’d say it’s worth it because of that fabulous puppet show earlier."

    Zephyr "I look forward to seeing you bring in new dolls to the scene as well. This could be my new hobby after reading my daily gossip columns."

    Rory "Yay, another fan acquired!~"

    Sylvian "I'm glad to see you back safely, my dear junior."

    Claude "Can't say I share the sentiment."

    Rory "Well, you're a few degrees short of cold-blooded, so I don't blame you."

    Sylvian "However, there's something we need to address."

    Lars narration "Master Sylvian’s steady voice resonates with unwavering conviction as he prepares to address Zephyr."

    Sylvian "Noble descendent, it’s clear that you’re manipulating a fundamental fabric of time for your personal gain. However, we cannot remain in this state too long."

    Lars narration "It seems like Master Sylvian will not be mentioning our displeasure about the brainwashed army at his castle. It’s probably best to keep a secret for now."

    Lars narration "Revealing everything we know at this moment could potentially tip the balance of power in an unfavorable direction."

    Zephyr "Here’s the fact, Smarty. I don’t understand the mechanics of it either and I don’t really have to."

    Zephyr "What I do know is that you guys can escape the effects of my family heirloom either because you’re special in some way or there’s a variable that I’m not aware of, like the counter artifact."

    Lars narration "Oh no, is he catching on to us?"

    Lars narration "I grasp the gemstone atop my clothes, my fingers wrapping around it tightly. It’s as if I’m seeking reassurance that our hidden card remains securely in our possession"

    Lars narration "Glancing over my shoulder, I catch sight of my tail wagging at full speed. The rhythmic swaying is almost involuntary, a physical manifestation of the heightened anxiety that Zephyr’s comments have stirred within me."

    Zephyr "But…enough of that imaginary scenario. when I take you back to my castle. You’ll join my army and I’ll be able to continue my renovation plans without any worries of someone trying to ruin it."

    Zephyr "Keyword being “try”."

    Zephyr "After all, you guys cannot escape from me while my artifact is still working."

    Lars narration "That’s literally what we’re trying to do here though!"

    Zephyr "What I’m sure of is that you guys are unique transported humans who are able to move in this limbo."

    Lars narration "But even that assumption is wrong! So, we really have nothing to move forward with."

    Zephyr "However, I can’t keep the time frozen forever, since I need to teach my new minions what they need to do."

    Claude "Your concerns are unwarranted since we can’t negotiate a deal without one party being absent, now can we?"

    Claude "In fact, we possess a proposition that might pique your interest."

    Zephyr "Hmm?"

    Claude "It appears you’re seeking some amusement, considering your remarks about the lackluster nature of your current companions. We could be the very diversion you yearn for."

    Zephyr "That won’t do, I can’t leave you guys alone since you can spoil my plans or come play around with the artifact when I’m not looking especially since I gave you the description for it."

    Rory "But that’s your problem, not ours!"

    Lars narration "Rory’s sudden outburst catches him completely off guard. The room falls into a brief hush before Zephyr’s voice breaks the silence once more."

    Zephyr "It’s your problem now. Speedy."

    Rory "Why do I feel like we’ve become Earthling pets of some sort with all these weird nicknames."

    Zephyr "Weeell, I’ve been surrounded by so many brainwashed humans during the castle renovations that my brain cells are rotting by the lack of creativity and putrid repeated phrases. You could say their antics are rubbing off on me."

    Zephyr "Anywho, how can you convince me that you won’t be an obstacle to my plan until my castle is restored?"

    Rory "We’ll pinky promise"

    Rory "That’s the most you can get from us."

    Zephyr "See? then there’s no reason for me to let you leave—"

    Lars narration "This won’t do! We must uncover the truth behind all of this."

    Lars narration "What kind of dragon pilot would I be if I gave up when faced with this obstacle?"

    Lars narration "I have a responsibility to protect my comrades."

    Lars default "We’ll earn your trust."

    Zephyr "Somehow, I really doubt—"

    Sylvian "[Lars]! What’re you trying to do?"

    Claude "I’m not a fan of what you’re trying to pull here, Captain. Especially since it’s without me."

    Lars default "You can’t pull that on us, you know? We also gave you a chance when you shared your story."

    Zephyr "…"

    Lars default "You just need to give us a few minutes and listen to our case."

    Zephyr "…"

    Zephyr "Ugh fine! But just for a little. It’s not like I wanted to repay you back for listening to me, okay? OKAY?"

    "Everyone" "He’s definitely repaying us for listening to him."

    Lars default "Master Sylvian, you’re the smartest person amongst us—"

    Claude "I’m hurt that you’re not even considering me Captain, but I also can’t deny that."

    Claude "You should have at least hesitated a bit…"

    Lars default "We need you to come up with a plan!"

    Sylvian "[Lars], why did you suggest such a thing to him?"

    Sylvian "He’s a dangerous person! Time—freezing? Brainwashing? How can you trust him so quickly after only a few conversations?"

    Sylvian "And now he’s focused on you, or whatever you’re planning to talk about with him."

    Lars default "I don’t trust him; I just think that it’s best if we decide on a plan so I don’t get tongue tied like the last time he asked me a question."

    Lars default "At least, I got us a little time so we can discuss our options."

    Claude "Sorry, Captain. But I’m siding with Boss on this one."

    Claude "Just to clarify, my reasons are a bit different."

    Claude "Boss Sylvian might want to divert his attention from us and discreetly find a solution to maintain his current peace and order. But I’m more inclined to jump right into the heart of the matter."

    Claude "He could be a secret royal heir for all I care, but I’m driven by curiosity. I can’t resist this challenge and let someone else take the credit for solving the mystery."

    Claude "I mean, a missing noble heir, a potentially unexplored castle, and an artifact that freezes time? When was the last time we faced a challenge like this?"

    Lars narration "Staying true to their personalities, both Master Sylvian and Sir Claude have their distinct motivations for wanting to unravel this mystery."

    Lars narration "As for me, I’m still uncertain about my own stance. Who should I confide in to discuss my decision?"

    Sylvian "To my surprise, a piece did fall within my grasp owning up to an incredible chance, miracle, or even mere luck and that piece is my precious guild. I don’t want you to do anything irrational and risk losing anyone."

    Lars default "I understand Master."

    Lars default "But, don’t worry, I have your back as well. I’m not going to let anyone touch my precious comrades!"

    Lars default "Let’s just talk it out with the others for now. Alright?"

    Sylvian "I suppose this conversation can wait for another time."

    Lars narration "As I move away to speak with the other members, I can hear a faint whisper but I don’t catch it in time."

    Sylvian "It’s been so long that I’ve reached out for a piece of my own accord that I’ve forgotten how to clench what’s already in the palm of my hand. (decrease font size to make it seem like a whisper)"

    Lars narration "I hope he didn’t say anything too serious."

    Claude "My dearest Captain [Lars], I adore your stubbornness at times like this, so it’s only right that I offer my support."

    Claude "I believe it’s wiser to pique our new Lord’s interest in us rather than dismiss it."

    Claude "Picture this— he realizes we’re ordinary individuals and decides to incorporate us into his team of renovators."

    Claude "However, that would likely cut off our access to any information from the other members of his so—called army."

    Lars narration "He raises his hands and uses gestures as if trying to visually explain his idea."

    Claude "What’s the aim here? We take out the brainwashed reincarnates and stop the effects of the time freeze artifact."

    Claude "That’s why taking direct action is imperative."

    Claude "I could take a more subtle approach and talk to the seller again, inquire about possible tools or learn the story behind our artifact."

    Claude "But I can’t risk losing my seat in this interesting show."

    Lars default "Sir Claude…"

    Claude "I would go on ahead on my own but I don’t want to leave my duo behind either."

    Claude "It would be no fun without you by my side, [Lars]."

    Lars narration "He called me [Lars]. I never thought I would hear him say my name in such a way."

    Lars narration "A serious expression is etched on Sir Claude’s face, and he gazes at me with anticipation."

    Lars narration "His conviction has been laid bare in his words, and it’s only fitting that I match his level of enthusiasm in this pivotal moment."

    Lars default "I understand!"

    Lars default "‘Discere, cogitare, agere— the triad of wisdom’."

    Lars default "I wasn’t born to be underestimated and I will protect you as well, Sir Claude."

    Lars narration "Perhaps it was the surge of my newfound conviction or the palpable anticipation of an impending challenge that sent my adrenaline levels soaring."

    Lars default "I can’t leave you all by yourself and I won’t have you take all the fun for yourself."

    Claude "That’s what I wanted to hear."

    Claude "Adventures favor the bold and fortunate."

    Claude "We’ll end up misusing our lifetime of luck if we don’t take up this chance."

    Lars default "That’s right, let’s get a move on now."

    Lars narration "As I move away to speak with the other members, I can hear Sir Claude make a loud declaration."

    Claude "I already used up a great portion of my luck so I can have this opportunity with you and I won’t give up on any chances!"

    Lars narration "What a riot…"

    Lars default "Alright everyone, if he truly is as dangerous as we all think, then we should try to get to the root of this issue and make sure he doesn’t use the time freeze artifact again."

    Lars default "I have a plan in mind so I hope you’ll support my choice."

    Sylvian "What will we—"

    Zephyr "Ah enough talking. Come here Scouty!"

    Rory "I’m rooting for you [Lars]y, show him what you’re made of!"

    Lars default "Young Lord Zephyr, we’ll be your private entertainers and the scoop you need for your renovation funds."

    Lars narration "I share a meaningful look with my fellow guild members, and it's clear that they are all equally puzzled. This is confirmed by their silence in response to my suggestion."

    Rory "I don’t think it’s too late to come back just as confidently, [Lars]…"

    Zephyr "What’re you trying to scheme Slicky? Are you trying to trick me with this sudden suggestion?"

    Lars default "It’s simple, we can’t stay suspended for too long."

    Lars default "You won’t let us leave either because we could prove to be an obstacle for you when you decide to constantly check on us and not your army of humans."

    Lars default "Hence, the best we can do is reach a compromise to suit both our interests."

    Claude "That’s the kind of negotiation skill I’d like to see."

    Zephyr "…and your idea of a compromise is for me to have you all entertain me and give me a scoop?"

    Lars default "You like to be entertained, don’t you? At your disposal, there is a famous merchant, puppet—master, magician, and a dragon pilot."

    Lars default "You can earn a column's worth of gossip material and earn your funds without hurting anyone. Didn’t you say that you dislike brainwashing and kidnapping people as well? This would work for the both of us."

    Zephyr "Hmm, such insolence."

    Zephyr "However, I like to have fun as well. How will you tip the odds in our favor?"

    Lars default "I don’t need to. We’re the only people who are aware of your situation and are still listening to you. That’s why we’re the best people who can cater to your interests."

    Sylvian "Good job, my junior. Don’t lose face now."

    Zephyr "That does make sense, so what will everyone be doing? I’m assuming Speedy will do some puppet show—"

    Lars default "You’ll only take me as your entertainer and you need to promise to let the others go."

    Zephyr "Huh—"

    "Everyone" "WHAAAAT????"

    Lars default "Our time is costly and others need to keep the guild running, so you have to make due with me.  I’m a dragon pilot as well, so we’ll have a lot of things in common."

    Lars (in head) default "Please, take the bait!"

    Zephyr "…"

    Zephyr "…two."

    Lars default "Hmm?"

    Zephyr "There will be two amongst you who’ll be my entertainers."

    Zephyr "I’ll take you to my castle and the rest of you can prance around as it."

    Zephyr "It’ll be a win—win situation for me since I can ensure that your friends won’t pull something with you kept as hostages——ehem! Entertainers."

    Zephyr "You have to keep me well entertained though! I’m a huge fan of confessions and duo comedies."

    Rory "So you're trying to ice-olate us."

    Zephyr "Finally! Somehow who understands my sense of humor."

    Lars default "But that’s not what I told you."

    Lars default "It’s only supposed to be me. And you have to promise not to even touch a single strand of fur or feather on the others."

    Lars default "You can’t take us to your castle either, who knows how dangerous it can be when it's not fully renovated yet?"

    Lars narration "If he does go after the other two, he’ll notice that we don’t have any special powers to counteract the artifacts' time suspension effect. We could all get caught! I don’t want to risk going to an unknown location either."

    Claude "Don’t get aggravated now, Captain. I’m not going to let you go down this route by yourself—"

    Sylvian "Forget the plan, we didn’t discuss this self—sacrificing scenario, [Lars]! You mustn’t risk—"

    Zephyr "Hey, Scouty, you didn’t listen to me, it seems. Single confessions are for the holy folk, not for entertainment."

    Zephyr "How are you going to do a duo comedy with only yourself?"

    Zephyr "Are you going to talk to your reflection in the mirror or your spineless shadow?"

    Zephyr "However, I’m a benevolent enough person so I give you the option to choose"

    Zephyr "Pick between Smarty and Slicky over there. They’re quite literally waiting to pounce on you right now."
