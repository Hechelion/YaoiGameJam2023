    Lars "Well, we are only four members at the moment but that’s beside the point."

    Lars "However, between us, Sir Claude had an insatiable hunger for adventure."

    Lars "Ah, the fascinating concept of reincarnation, a chain that connects our realm with Earth."

    Lars "When humans or descendants pass away, they have the choice of transferring over to Divonia and vice versa."

    Lars "However, the key distinction in this process lay in the fact that, despite undergoing reincarnation, individuals retain features from their previous life since they only have once chance of descending to another realm after death."

    Lars "For the descendants, this meant that as they grew older, their animalistic characteristics would become more pronounced whether on Divonia or on Earth. Conversely, for those souls reborn with their origins rooted in humanity, the opposite held true."

    Lars "This phenomenon meant that by the time both Earthlings and Divs began to walk and talk, their origins would be unmistakably evident."

    Lars "It could be through traits, such as pointed ears, a bushy tail, or even a soft fur covering certain parts of their body and many more"

    Lars "However, throughout my time in Divonia, I seldom came across reincarnates."

    Lars "They were a rarity, as not many chose to undertake the journey of transitioning to a new realm they knew nothing about."

    Lars "Most of my fellow guild members were new souls, born and raised here, so I didn’t have the chance to be closely work with one of the reincarnates either."

    Lars "For those who did decide to descend into Divonia, it was a leap of faith into the unknown."

    Lars "Unfortunately, this sense of vulnerability could attract scammers and opportunists who sought to take advantage of the newcomers' lack of knowledge."

    Lars "They would attempt to exploit their naivety, coercing them into labor or other unfavorable situations, exploiting their unfamiliarity with Div customs and culture."

    Claude "Awe, I’ll pretend to be hurt but while I’m still here, take my advice. You have to challenge yourself more."

    Claude "You won’t be able to show off your talents to anyone when you spend your time with these childish competitions. How will you be able to prove yourself to the elite if you only ever rival with kids?"

    Lars "Not everything is a contest to prove oneself, Sir Claude."

    Lars "Sometimes, I can be content with just playing around and enjoying the moment as is. Isn’t that right, Master?"

    Lars "Family legacy …"

    Lars "It was certainly true that Sir Claude had the tendency to act out against his family’s wishes from time to time but according to the rumor mills, he didn’t have a reason too."

    Lars "The Dupont family, a lovely couple of lizard descendants, never strived Claude of love and affection which was something that he confirmed as well."

    Claude "Though I value your presence in our guild and your support of my endeavors {i}Boss{/i}, you have let go of all your desires and merely follow the direction that your flowery path takes you."

    Lars "When it came to dreams, Master Sylvian had garnered quite the reputation as the ‘genius of the century’ during his tenure at the Tower of Magicians in Divonia."

    Lars "Although he rarely spoke about his past experiences, a glimpse into his emotions could be seen in the way his feathers drooped and his shoulders slumped with a sense of dejection whenever the topic came up."

    Lars "Even his perpetual hunched posture served as a constant reminder of his time as a prestigious state magician. A time where he would work himself to the bone day and night with no rest in between."

    Lars "Despite his current focus on flower magic, it was evident that Master Sylvian had a different area of expertise in the past. The secrets and stories behind his prior magic remained locked away, untold."

    Claude "{i}Discere, cogitare, agere{/i}- the triad of wisdom. Learning enriches the mind, and thinking sharpens it, but it is through action that we truly manifest our knowledge and shape our reality."

    Claude "You have the first two down but you’re running away from the third step."

    "Sylvian" "However, …"

    "Sylvian" "Amidst our pursuit of them, let us not overlook the tranquility of mediocrity."

    "Sylvian" "For not every path must lead to grand creations or extraordinary feats."

    "Sylvian" "In embracing simplicity, we find contentment, and in cherishing the ordinary, we discover the beauty of a life unburdened by the pressures of relentless ambition."

    Claude "Aren’t you saying that only because you were burnt out and having nothing else to pursue?"

    Claude "If you always treasured this so-called ‘contentment’ why did you decide to spread your name onto society as the top academic of Divonia?"

    Claude "That’s right! We’ve been walking around this issue for some time now and we haven’t learnt one single coherent thing from you. Just bits and pieces that aren’t helping us get out of this mess. Maybe you’re just a minion for someone else’s plan-"

    Lars "You woke up, broke and homeless. You decided to use free labor from the descendants to clean up the mess in your castle. However, you couldn’t pay their wages properly. You then decided to slave away unsuspecting humans since they were ignorant about the rules of the realm."

    Lars "But why did you decide to use the time freeze artifact in the first place?"

    "Zephyr" "How could I bring them back to my castle without explaining the situation to them? They would get suspicious and run away from now. You know how hard I've worked to manually capture the humans and brainwash them to fix up my home?"

    Claude "You’re obviously lacking a certain moral regard to be paying your employees so poorly and even-"

    "Zephyr" "I didn’t want to, okay? But what other choice did I have?"

    "Zephyr" "I couldn’t win them over with my title and I couldn’t make them work with the little money either."

    "Zephyr" "The time freeze did help me in relocating them and making sure I was the first one I spoke too so I could make my situation clear so it was the easier solution for me. I’d pay them back once {i}he{/i} comes back anyways."

    "Zephyr" "The mind control was always a last measure for me and even now I’m just left with an army of zombies and eternally doomed to be bored out of my mind."

    Claude "Weren’t you the same person who tried to threaten us with brainwashing before you-"

    "Zephyr" "It wasn’t like I was bluffing to make you spill what info you had. I’m not that forgetful, okay? OKAY?"

    "Everyone" "He’s definitely that forgetful."

    Lars "I don’t understand which plan we’re supposed to follow, Master."

    "Sylvian" "You have to understand, Lars. We need to show how powerless we are in front of him so he loses interest."

    "Sylvian" "If he gets curious about the origins of the artifact, things could take a dangerous turn."

    "Sylvian" "He basically admitted to slaving away humas and descendants alike just to have the previous person withholding our artifact to return."

    "Sylvian" "Does any of that sound rational to you?"

    Lars "No, but shouldn’t we aim to ruin his plan for the same reason?"

    Lars "He's robbing unsuspecting Divs of their freedom. As members of \"Custodes Sylvae,\" our duty is to rescue them-"

    "Sylvian" "We're just a merchant guild, Lars. I understand your sentiments, but we can't rush into things like this."

    "Sylvian" "We need more information about the artifact and then we can devise a plan to infiltrate his base, wherever it might be."

    Lars "But how can we be sure if we'll ever get another chance to speak with him like this, or if our countermeasure necklace will work again?"

    "Sylvian" "“Have patience. All things are difficult before they become easy.”"

    "Sylvian" "If we're patient, an opportunity will arise."

    "Sylvian" "I can't let him get his hands on any of my valuable guild members, {i}especially{/i} not you."

    Lars "What do you mean, master?"

    "Sylvian" "You see Lars, my world had become quite misshapen during my days in academia, akin to a scrambled puzzle. I had entered a stance where I couldn’t go forward until each piece fell into my hand"

    "Sylvian" "To my surprise, a piece did fall within my grasp owning up to an incredible chance, miracle, or even mere luck and that piece is my precious guild. I don’t want you to do anything irrational and risk losing anyone."

    Lars "I understand Master."

    Lars "But, don’t worry, I have your back as well. I’m not going to let anyone touch my precious comrades!"

    Lars "Let’s just talk it out with the others for now. Alright?"

    "Sylvian" "I suppose this conversation can wait for another time."

    Claude "My dearest Captain Lars, I adore your stubbornness at times like this, so it’s only right that I offer my support."

    Claude "I believe it's wiser to pique our new lord's interest in us rather than dismiss it."

    Claude "Picture this- he realizes we're ordinary individuals and decides to incorporate us into his team of {i}renovators{/i}."

    Claude "But I can’t risk losing my seat in this interesting show."

    Lars "Alright everyone, if he truly is as dangerous as we all think, then we should try to get to the root of this issue and make sure he doesn’t use the time freeze artifact again."

    Lars "It’s simple, we can’t stay suspended for too long."

    Lars "You won’t let us leave either because we could prove to be an obstacle for you when you decide to constantly check on us and not your army of humans."

    Lars "Hence, best we can do is reach a compromise to suit both our interests."

    Claude "That’s the kind of negotiation skill I’d like to see."

    "Zephyr" "…and your idea of a compromise is for me to have you all entertain me?"

    Lars "You like to be entertained, don’t you?"

    "Zephyr" "Hmm, such insolence."

    "Zephyr" "However, I like to have fun as well. How will you tip the odds to our favor?"

    Lars "That’s why we’re the best people who can cater to your interests."

    "Sylvian" "Good job, my junior. Don’t lose face now."

    "Zephyr" "That does make sense, so what will everyone be doing? I’m assuming Speedy will do some puppet show-"

    "Zephyr" "Hey, Scouty, you didn’t listen to me, it seems. Single confessions are for the holy folk, not for entertainment."

    "Zephyr" "How are you going to do a duo comedy with only yourself?"

    "Zephyr" "Are you going to talk to your reflection in the mirror or your spinless shadow?"
