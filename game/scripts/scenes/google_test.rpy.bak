    "Sylvian" "He basically admitted to slaving away humans and descendants alike just to have the previous person withholding our artifact to return."

    "Sylvian" "Does any of that sound rational to you?"

    Lars "No, but shouldn’t we aim to ruin his plan for the same reason?"

    Lars "He's robbing unsuspecting Divs of their freedom. As members of \"Custodes Sylvae,\" our duty is to rescue them-"

    "Sylvian" "We're just a merchant guild, Lars. I understand your sentiments, but we can't rush into things like this."

    "Sylvian" "We need more information about the artifact and then we can devise a plan to infiltrate his base, wherever it might be."

    Lars "But how can we be sure if we'll ever get another chance to speak with him like this, or if our countermeasure necklace will work again?"

    "Sylvian" "“Have patience. All things are difficult before they become easy.”"

    "Sylvian" "To my surprise, a piece did fall within my grasp owning up to an incredible chance, miracle, or even mere luck and that piece is my precious guild. I don’t want you to do anything irrational and risk losing anyone."

    Lars "I understand Master."
