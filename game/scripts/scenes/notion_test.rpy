    Lars "Discere, cogitare, agere- the triad of wisdom. Learning enriches the mind, and thinking sharpens it, but it is through action that we truly manifest our knowledge and shape our reality."

    Lars "You would think that a merchant guild wouldn’t bother creating such a philosophical motto and instead advertise 1+1 dragon ship seats every holiday season."

    Lars "We could even offer complementary earth meals from the reincarnated human chefs who arrived to the realm of Zephyr."

    Lars "But then again, we wouldn’t be embarking on artifact hunts and treasure expeditions if our guild’s only purpose was commerce."

    Claude "Our dearest Captain Lars! are you mumbling to yourself again?"

    Claude "Or are you whispering trade-secret shortcuts to your, or more so, MY lovely dragon, Spotsy?"

    Lars "Bad at naming as always, Sir Claude. Especially for this fine species of polka dot ruby fireblazer."

    Lars "Look at how these scales are gleaming with a crimson hue! Did you know that as she breathes, the intense heat generated caused by her metabolism can cause the air pockets under her scales to shimmer and expand? These ruby reminiscent distortions aren’t for mere show either, Guild master Sylvian mentioned that certain blacksmiths can use the ensuing heat for their forging practices. I studied a lot about this since Rory mentioned she wanted to help out her family, and you know how she can be as stubborn as a mule. Well, she’s technically a bull descendent so that’s beside the point but-"

    Claude "Focus on your dragon steering Captain! I wouldn’t want to be that poor passenger who reincarnates early to the Earth realm just because you were adoring our newest ship."

    Claude "I did make quite an effort to negotiate for her, after all."

    Claude "But this wouldn’t be the first dragon ship I’ve acquired. I need a new challenge after the last one..."

    Lars "Shhh Sir Claude! You’re going to hurt Spotsy’s feelings. Not to mention, she’ll get confused and make a false move if you don’t stop bothering me."

    Lars "The tabloids would have a field day if you were to fall off."

    Lars "But more importantly, Guild master Sylvian would be quite upset if our guild got noticed only for your publicity stunt."

    Claude "Tsk, tsk, Captain, you should know that a few gossiping papers doesn’t make any difference for me."

    Claude "Not because all publicity is good publicity, that’s just a standard industry cliché."

    Claude "It’s because I only ever seek to be the greatest merchant there is and I will use every tool at my disposal to achieve it."

    Lars "Really? I didn’t know our young master liked being at the center of attention. You always seem to be hiding that you’re the only heir of the infamous Dupont merchant family. At first, I thought it was so there wouldn’t be any rumors of our Guild being associated with your family name, but you’ve always been acting suspiciously about it. You never seem to give out your last name during our expeditions or client meetings and come to think of it your gala partner at the scale ball, did mention that you were using a disguise spell-"

    Claude "Captain, I didn’t think that you were interested in my personal life all that much."

    Claude "I could satisfy your curiosity by merely saying that I enjoy the challenge of making my own name…"

    Claude "…but then you’ll have to satisfy my curious question as well, which would be the reason behind your wagging tail that you’re so cutely trying to hide-"

    Lars "THEN I SUPPOSE you’d have no problem if the headlines were to go like this-"

    Lars "‘The rising star, Claude from the infamous Dupont merchant family, tragically plummets to his death as a result of angering the fireblazer dragon ship captain. The tragic mistake of paying 250 thousand gold coins for a chance to reach the skies, only to become a gourmet meal for his ancestors.’"

    Claude "Haha, my dear captain, are you planning to bankrupt the entire realm with those numbers?"

    Claude "Or did you hear them from your human passengers again?"

    Claude "I’ve missed talking with them, but the recent seasonal galas are filling up my timetable."

    Claude "Not to mention our recent artifact negotiations. Who knew a single necklace would end up causing me to bicker with the seller so much."

    Claude "You’d think he dug it up from his family grave with the way he clung to it even though it was just a random artifact that appeared out of thin air."

    Claude "Besides, captain, you should know better than to recklessly use the Dupont last name."

    Claude "I prefer it when you say my name after all. It’s one of the tiny joys of my life."

    Lars "W-w-what are you saying all of a sudden?! Did you lose your mind?"

    Lars "If you tease me again, I really won’t be able to guarantee your safety…"

    Lars "…so, s-stop it."

    Claude "Awe, is our captain getting shy all of a sudden? Did you know your ears get red when your embarrassed?"

    Lars "Y-y-you just keep spouting lies; I should know better than to trust your lizard tongue."

    Claude "You know, if we ever crash, we could go down the reincarnation route together."

    Claude "I wouldn’t mind starting over as long as there’s something new to conquer. We would make quite the adventurous pair as well."

    Claude "Life gets pretty boring when you have everything you need in the palm of your hand."

    Lars "Wait, does that have something to do with your family-"

    Claude "You know Captain-"

    Claude "Our mansions scholar, the Archmage of Zephyr, used to tell me that the upper echelon of humans on earth fly in the skies by genetically mutated wings, you could say it’s similar to what Boss Sylvian has. They can even turn their pets to humans while maintaining their innate animal traits such as ears, tails and many more."

    Claude "In fact, you could be similar to one of their domesticated fox breeds and-"

    Lars "You’re lying! How on earth did they do that? You’re not teasing me like last time, are you? Like how you mentioned that a couple reincarnated together. Because I did ask Sylvian and he swore that the only mention similar to your story was if two reincarnations happened at the same time and even then, they could end up in a nearby location, but not next to each other. I didn’t hear any of the passengers talk about it either! Come to think of it, Rory did mention some people casting their lover’s dead soul into puppets and releasing them when their partner dies to match the timing, but I thought that was just a children’s tale. Both Sylvian and Rory said-"

    Claude "As much as I hate to cut you off your cute rambling captain, I think we’ll have to save our conversation for later."

    Claude "Our dearest guild master’s staff is lighting our landing spot. You’ll be blinded by the number of sunflowers and roses he set up."

    Claude "His idea of guiding us with flower colors is as gentle as always."

    Claude "Yet, it’s frightening when you think of the power he’s hiding in those roots and stalks…"

    Lars "Ah, it’s a shame. I was hoping to learn something new. We reached home way earlier than I expected as always. I have to reward Spotsy well when we get back."

    Claude "I’d be inclined to say that you didn’t manage to tap into our dragon’s full potential captain. Owning up to how I stole your attention for more than half, or better yet, the entire ride."

    Lars "Ugh, I should have pushed you off the dragon’s back myself-"

    Claude "However, since you managed to get us here without any dangerous maneuvers, I’ll allow you to be the first to touch our newest artifact."

    Claude "It’s the first time it’s made its way to our side of the realm, making the occasion quite momentous, wouldn’t you say?"

    "Sylvian" "In a sky where dragons soar with grace, a guild of merchants finds its place. With sunflowers and roses in their hands, they guide passengers to enchanted lands. Welcome back, dear members of “Custodes Sylvae”. I’m happy to see that you both landed safely."

    "Sylvian" "Lars, your piloting was truly magnificent as always. It’s a sight that I’m honored to witness every time."

    Claude "It wouldn’t be a warm welcome if Master Sylvian weren’t here to recite his poetry. I missed having someone challenging to tease, Captain Lars over here is too gullible and makes it child play for me HAHAHA!"

    Lars "Thank you, Master. I wish you could have joined us on the ride too. Sir Claude here almost caused us to plummet to our doom... twice."

    Claude "Eh, I did promise to reward you later, didn’t I? drum roll please ~ Behold!-"

    Claude "Ah, but wait, I seem to have left it on the ship. Captain, could you be so kind as to bring our precious cargo?"

    "Sylvian" "Claude, remember what I said about teasing him too much? Besides, if Rory catches you giving Lars trouble again..."

    "Rory" "Clauuudy~"

    "Rory" "I believe I mentioned that if I ever catch you bossing Larsy around, I’d pluck out your lizard eyes to adorn my newest puppet, Agatha."

    "Rory" "You should know that my threats work quite effectively, especially with how Brittney’s puppet dress is shimmering with the scales you’ve kindly donated... in your sleep, of course."

    Claude "If it isn’t our hot-tempered bull, breathing fire as soon as she lays eyes on me. It’s a pleasure to see you again, little Rory. Or should I say, a curse to behold?"

    "Rory" "Hoy! I told you never to call me that again! And doesn’t your receding hairline remind you that half your hair now belongs to Puppet Alex because you called me a midget last time?!"

    Claude "Now, now, I would have to say these finely braided silver strands that I’ve so kindly donated to you are what’s bringing half the revenue for your puppet shows, aren’t they little Rory?"

    "Rory" "I warned you not to call me that, you cheap lizard!"

    "Rory" "You really have the gall to be talking to me when all your travel funds are conveniently collected from my shows."

    "Rory" "For the sake of compensation, it’s time to say goodbye to Claude Junior with my nifty scissor too-"

    Lars "I’m back with the cargo!"

    "Rory" "Larsy, you’re back! Awe, I missed you so much. One more minute with my arch-nemesis over here and his rag-like face would be honored by my vomit."

    Lars "Come on Rory, you don’t really mean that."

    "Rory" "I have never meant anything more in all my bull years."

    Claude "That explains why you’re such a bullshitting-"

    Lars "AHEM! Claude, why don’t you help me out with carrying this box? It’s quite heavy for me to carry."

    "Sylvian" "Are you feeling okay? Do you need me to cast a relief spell for you?"

    "Sylvian" "Carrying such heavy things might affect your health after all. That was one of the main things my academic years taught me aside from all the other … unique experiences."

    Lars "It’s okay master, I needed to get in my daily dose of exercise too. I don’t want you to think that I’m too weak for one box! I just wanted to make Claude too busy to argue with Rory. You know how I’ve spoilt Rory; I can’t talk back to her in these kinds of situations. More than that, what would our passengers think if their pilot wasn’t able to pick up a heavily gold-adorned box from their dragon’s second cargo-specific stomach and not run around its spiky back, over the landing port, to deliver the artifact? Would they think it’s animal abuse because the dragon isn’t using its second stomach for food? What if they think we’re slaving them away?! My parents wouldn’t let me live this down if they ever heard such rumors. But they don’t use their second stomach for food anyways; it’s mostly for material to build their nests. Ah, but Shabadoo the sheep did say that some species use the second for mined gemstones and Mrs. Parvizi did say that some use it for mating rituals and holding fireflies to light up their ceremonial dance. Maybe I am taking away their chance at doing these things..."

    "Sylvian" "Lars, I understand. Now, let’s use that breathing technique that the humans thought us last time. You remember? Breathe for 3 seconds, hold it for 6, and then release it for 9 seconds."

    "Sylvian" "No one is going to think those things of you, Lars."

    "Sylvian" "In every whispered phrase, a friendship blooms. You who cherish your dragon’s well-being, dispelling any gloom. For their safety, you would give your all. A protector, a guardian, answering their call."

    "Sylvian" "If I were a dragon, I wouldn’t want any other handler than you to take care of me."

    Claude "SOOO, what I gather is that Master Sylvian wants to have Lars ride him-"

    "Rory" "SHUT UP! You wouldn’t dream of understanding my mentor’s cherished feelings for Larsy."

    "Rory" "Even if he did like Lars that way, it’s not as if he would wait years in an unrequited crush just to waste away his life singing little poetry praises and blooming flowers out of thin air."

    "Rory" "Honestly, I don’t even know what Lars sees in you that makes him like-"

    Lars "AHHHHHHH- STOP RORY! HOLD ON!"

    Lars "NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP, NEVER GONNA LET YOU DOWN. NEVER GONNA RUN AROUND AND DESERT YOU."

    Claude "As much as I like it when you sing those human songs captain, I think we’re better off witnessing the artifact before the evening sets and little Rory decides to defile my innocent body with her tools."

    Claude "I can see fumes exiting her head as we speak. Oh! ************* I think they got even bigger."

    "Sylvian" "Alright everyone, settle down."

    "Sylvian" "Let me cast a safety spell over the box first, you can never be sure if there are any hidden traps inside."

    "Sylvian" "No traps or enchantments detected. It seems we’re in the clear. Let’s unveil the treasure within."

    Claude "Before anyone starts their inspection, I promised our dear captain he’d be the first person to hold it."
